#Static Timing Analysis - Basics

# Wha is STA?
Static Timing Analysis is used to verify whether a digital design meets timing constraints without requiring dynamic simulation.

# Key Concepts
Arrival Time
Required Time
Slack
Setup and Hold Checks
Clock Skew
On Chip Variation
Advanced On Chip Variation
Parametric On Chip Variation
Clock Reconvergence Pessimism Removal

# Slack
Slack = Required Time - Arrival Time

Positive Slack: Timing met
Negative Slacl: Timing violation
Zero Slack: Bondary condition

# Why STA is important
STA ensures reliable operation of the chip across PVT corners before fabrication.
